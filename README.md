# full-stack-React-app-REST-API
 This project uses React to create a client for a school database REST API. The full stack application enables users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.  In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.
